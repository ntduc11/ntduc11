### 🙏🙏🙏 NAMASTE 🙏🙏🙏
* My name is Nguyen Trung Duc and I am interested in functional phenomics and quantitative genetics.
* 👨‍🔬 I am a Researcher at Crops Research and Development Institute (CRDI) – Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA)
* I studied Master in Agricultural Science, Plant Physiology, ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute. 🌾🌽 My MSc. research was focused on consolidating multiple omics data to understand and improve nitrogen use efficiency in rice. My research aims to combine genomics and phenomics approaches to investigate how rice responds to low nitrogen consumption and to provide mechanisms to enhance their response.
* I am currently doing PhD in Kyushu University, Graduate School of Bioresource and Bioenvironmental Science, Mathematical Modeling Laboratory.
